# Download free RAM, right HERE!
That's not all, folks, we are handing out all sorts of computer parts, free of charge! (and actual delivery)

well, ok.
I thought a simple sign-up page was too simple, so I decided to revisit that time where I was made to believe that RAM could actually be downloaded off the internet. Oh, what an idiot I was.

The main highlight of this page is quite obviously the form. I've put off completing this bit of the Odin Project for so long, but it's finally done. No javascript included, meaning nothing actually happens  - everything here is just HTML and CSS.

Don't mind the page being a bit buggy, please. It's one of my lower-effort, speedran-through websites.

And yes, the entire premise of the website is A JOKE. I do not mean any harm to anyone whatsoever :D
